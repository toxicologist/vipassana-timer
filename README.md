For example, if one wanted to do 10 minutes walking and 10 sitting:
```sh
# example usage
>meditate w10s10

#or
>meditate
Enter times (format: 'p5w30s30'): w10s10

#result

Times:
Walking: 10
Sitting: 10

Walking: 10:00 remaining
```

Or, to do 35 minutes of sitting:
```sh
>meditate s35

Times:
Sitting: 35

Sitting: 35:00 remaining
```


If you want to add your own posture, just edit the `POSTURES` variable in `__init__.py`.

## Good luck meditating! :)
